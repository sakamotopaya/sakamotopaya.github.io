I guess I started this project to learn. I like to tinker and thought building a 'smart home' style system to link them all together sounded like a fun project. That was sometime ago :). And it has been fun. I've built several neat little gadgets and have many more planned.

But along the way a few things happened. First, I realized that these companies are charging us way too much and second, I began to better understand what they were doing with our data. 

I also began to think that maybe this was the thing I could give back. Something that others would find useful.

So there it is. The reasons this project exists. 

Oh, why the name? Eric and Lisa Oliver was how it started but I liked that when you make it 'ELO it became friendly and reminded you of home.
